The Thesis project.Rmd file contains all code related to my thesis project.The Asa Julien distribution.docx file is my final written manuscript; I have to fix a couple of formatting issues though. I've also uploaded my data; the Ash_grids.csv file has all of the elevation data that I used for my analyses.


I'd been working from a different repository, but I recently (4/18/17) moved everything to this one becasue the organization makes a little more sense.
